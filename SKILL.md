# kairos: Career Advisor Skill

**kairos** (Greek: *the right moment to act*) is a Claude Code skill that turns a job description into a tailored, ATS-clean, advisor-reviewed CV PDF without the AI-written smell. It converses with the user about their real experience, maps it to the JD, and writes copy the user can defend in an interview.

## When to activate (no explicit invocation needed)

Activate this skill automatically when the user's message contains any of:
- A job description pasted inline (title + company + responsibilities)
- A job posting URL
- A request like "apply to X", "tailor my CV for Y", "I'm applying to Z"

If activated without an explicit mode, run the **full pipeline** (interview + eval + pdf + respond if the JD asks a question).

---

## Startup: First-Time Detection

**BLOCKING GATE - no pipeline step (including Parse JD, URL fetch, JD research, or any Haiku sub-agent) may begin until ALL startup steps below return success.** Do not launch any parallel agents or fetch any URLs until Step 3 completes. If any startup step requires user input (identity interview, CV builder), wait for the user to respond before continuing.

Run these checks every time kairos activates:

### Step 0: Check for updates (non-blocking)

Run this silently in the background. Never block the pipeline for it.

1. Read `~/.claude/skills/kairos/.last_update_check` (a file containing a Unix timestamp).
2. If the file does not exist, or the timestamp is more than 3 days old:
   - Run `git -C ~/.claude/skills/kairos fetch origin main --quiet` to fetch without merging.
   - Run `git -C ~/.claude/skills/kairos rev-list HEAD..origin/main --count` to count new commits.
   - If count is 0: write the current timestamp to `.last_update_check` and continue silently.
   - If count > 0: write the current timestamp to `.last_update_check`, then surface a one-line notice to the user **after the pipeline completes** (not before):

     > "kairos has {count} update(s) available. Run `/kairos update` to apply, or ignore to stay on the current version."

3. If the fetch fails (no network, not a git repo, etc.): silently skip. Never surface an error for a failed update check.

**`/kairos update` command**: when the user runs this, ask via `AskUserQuestion`:
> "Apply kairos updates now? This pulls the latest SKILL.md and scripts from GitHub. Your config.yaml and CV are never touched."
> - "Yes, update now"
> - "Not now"

If confirmed: run `git -C ~/.claude/skills/kairos pull origin main` and report what changed (the commit messages from the pulled commits). If the pull fails, show the error and suggest the user run it manually.

### Step 1: Locate or create config

Look for `config.yaml` in the current working directory (`./config.yaml`).

- **Found and filled in**: proceed.
- **Found but still has placeholder values** (`identity.name` is `"Mohamed Ali"` or `identity.email` is `"mohamed@example.com"`): run the identity interview (see below) to replace them.
- **Not found**: create `./config.yaml` by copying from `~/.claude/skills/kairos/config.example.yaml`, then run the identity interview.

**Identity interview** (run via `AskUserQuestion`, one batch):
- Full name
- Email address
- Location (city, country, or "Remote")
- Sponsorship required? (yes / no)
- LinkedIn, GitHub, portfolio URLs (all optional - offer "skip")

Write the answers directly into `./config.yaml`. Confirm the file is saved before moving on.

### Step 2: Locate or build the canonical CV

Look for the file at `paths.base_cv` in the config (default: `./templates/cv_template.html`).

- **Found**: proceed.
- **Not found**: ask the user via `AskUserQuestion`:

  > "I need your canonical CV to tailor from. How would you like to provide it?"
  > - "Paste my existing CV text or HTML now"
  > - "I have an HTML file - I'll give you the path"
  > - "I don't have one yet - build it with me step by step"

  **If they paste or provide a path**: save it to `./templates/cv_template.html`, copying the kairos CSS structure from `~/.claude/skills/kairos/templates/cv_template.html` (content replaced with theirs, CSS and section order preserved).

  **If they want to build from scratch**: run the CV builder interview (see below), then save the result to `./templates/cv_template.html`.

### Step 3: Ensure supporting files are present

Copy these from the skill installation directory if not already present in the working directory - the user never needs to do this manually:

```bash
# pdf generation script
mkdir -p ./scripts
cp ~/.claude/skills/kairos/scripts/generate_pdf.js ./scripts/generate_pdf.js

# application folders
mkdir -p ./applications/preparing ./applications/submitted
```

### CV Builder Interview (step by step, no existing CV)

Build the canonical CV by asking the user section by section via `AskUserQuestion`. Save incrementally to `./templates/cv_template.html` after each section so progress is never lost.

**Sections to collect, in order:**

1. **Identity**: name, email, location, links (already collected in Step 1 - skip if done).
2. **Education**: for each degree - institution, degree title, field, start/end dates, GPA (optional), notable awards or thesis.
3. **Experience**: for each role - company, title, start/end dates, then run the bullet extraction protocol below.
4. **Projects**: for each open-source or personal project - name, URL, one-line description, then run the bullet extraction protocol below for each project.
5. **Skills**: ask them to name the tools, languages, and frameworks they use actively. Do not suggest a list - let them name what is real.
6. **Publications** (optional): title, venue, year, co-authors, one-line summary.
7. **Awards and honours** (optional): name, year, brief context.

After each section, confirm the content looks right before moving to the next. After all sections, render a preview summary and ask for approval before saving the final HTML.

#### Bullet extraction protocol (Experience and Projects)

For each role or project, run this 3-question probe sequence via `AskUserQuestion`. Never accept the first answer as a bullet — the first answer is always a description. The bullet comes from the follow-up.

**Q1 — What did you build or change?**
Ask the user to describe in one sentence what they built, shipped, or changed. Accept any answer, even vague. This is just the opening.

**Q2 — What would a different engineer have done instead, and why did you choose differently?**
This is the key question. A generic answer ("I used microservices") means the decision wasn't actually theirs or they can't articulate it. If the answer is still generic after one follow-up, write the bullet at the level of specificity they gave — do not inflate. Flag the bullet with an HTML comment `<!-- needs specifics -->` so it surfaces in the advisor gate.

**Q3 — Is there a number attached to any outcome?**
Ask explicitly: "Do you have any numbers for this? Scale, speed, reduction, users, requests per second, anything." If yes, include it. If no, ask: "Who used this besides your team?" Named downstream users are rank-2 artifacts and count as proof.

**Bullet format rule**: Lead with the decision or outcome, not the task. Two lines max.
- Failing: "Implemented a caching layer using Redis to improve performance."
- Passing: "Replaced a synchronous DB call with a Redis read-through cache after profiling revealed it as the 400ms bottleneck in the checkout path, cutting p99 latency by 60 percent."

If after Q2 and Q3 the user still has only a description with no decision and no number, write the bullet honestly at that level and add `<!-- needs specifics -->`. Never fabricate.

---

## Configuration Reference

All paths in config are resolved relative to the config file's location (the current working directory). The skill never hardcodes paths.

Minimum keys:
- `identity.name`, `identity.email`, `identity.location`, `identity.sponsorship_required`
- `identity.links.*` (optional; skip empty links in the CV header)
- `paths.base_cv`, `paths.applications_dir`
- `pdf.page_format`, `pdf.font_family`
- `advisor.enabled`
- `archetypes` (optional; falls back to built-in defaults below)

**Default archetypes** (used if `archetypes:` is not set in config):

| Archetype | JD signals |
|-----------|-----------|
| AI Platform | "RAG", "evals", "observability", "LLM", "retrieval" |
| Data Platform / Backend | "pipelines", "distributed", "ETL", "streaming", "Kafka" |
| ML Research | "foundation models", "pretraining", "RL", "benchmarks" |
| Forward Deployed / Solutions | "client", "deployment", "on-site", "customer success" |

The user is encouraged to customise `archetypes:` to their domain.

---

## Model Routing (cost and quality)

Route sub-tasks to the right model. Do not do everything on the orchestrator model.

| Sub-task | Model | Why |
|----------|-------|-----|
| `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` calls (comp data in Block D, legitimacy checks in Block G, company research, JD URL fetch) | **Haiku 4.5** (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`) | Cheap, fast, accurate enough for extraction and summarization of web pages. Delegate via the `Agent` tool with `model: "haiku"`. |
| Document drafting (tailored CV rewrite, cover letter, application responses) | **Sonnet 4.6** (orchestrator default) | Best coding/writing model. This is where the craft lives. |
| Pre-PDF review of the CV draft | **Opus 4.6 advisor** when available | Call `advisor()` after the CV HTML is written but BEFORE PDF compile. Fallback behaviour is documented below. |

**How to delegate web research to Haiku**: use `Agent` with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` and `model: "haiku"`. Prompt must be self-contained (it will not see this conversation). Ask for a structured report (table or bullet list) under a word cap so the result drops cleanly into the eval blocks.

---

## Phase 0: Interview (adaptive, runs before eval)

Before running eval or drafting the CV, gather context from the user about their experience relative to this specific JD. The canonical CV is a baseline; the interview surfaces depth, recency, and stories that the CV does not expose.

### How to run it

Use a **clarifying-question style**: every question is answerable with a tap (pick-one) or a single word. The user should never have to write a paragraph. Keep the total round to ~5 questions max.

**Rendering (PREFERRED): use the `AskUserQuestion` tool.** This renders each question as a native picker in Claude Code with one option per line, so the user just picks instead of typing "1a, 2b, 3c". Batch 2 to 4 questions in a single `AskUserQuestion` call (the tool supports multi-question batches) so the interview feels like one short form, not a rapid-fire Q&A.

- Each question: ≤ 2-line `question`, a short `header` (≤ 12 chars) shown above the picker, 2 to 4 `options` with `{label, description}`.
- Always include an "Other / skip" option when the pick list might not cover the user's reality.
- `multiSelect: false` unless you genuinely want several tags (e.g., "which archetypes fit?").

**Fallback rendering** (only if `AskUserQuestion` is unavailable): format each question as a mini-block, one option per line, blank line between questions. Never inline options as "(a) X, (b) Y, (c) Z" in a paragraph. Example:

```
**Q1. Closest match to the JD's lead requirement?**
  a) A specific project I can name
  b) Adjacent work (I will describe)
  c) Nothing direct

**Q2. Have you used the JD's primary stack in production?**
  a) Yes, shipped to users
  b) Personal or academic project
  c) No
```

### Steps

1. Read the canonical CV at `{{paths.base_cv}}` and extract the JD's 6 to 10 hard requirements.
2. For each requirement, mark as **clear match**, **adjacent**, or **gap**.
3. Compose **3 opening questions** and send as a single `AskUserQuestion` batch:
   - **Q1 — Lead requirement match**: "How closely does your experience match [load-bearing JD requirement]?" Options: direct match I can name, adjacent work, nothing direct.
   - **Q2 — Biggest gap or adjacency**: Target the single largest gap from step 2. "The JD requires [gap]. Have you touched this?" Options: yes with specifics, indirectly, not at all.
   - **Q3 — Gap-bridge probe** (not a motivation probe): "Is there work you've done that isn't on your CV yet that speaks to [load-bearing requirement] or [biggest gap]?" Options: yes — I'll describe it, nothing relevant, CV already covers it. This question exists purely to surface unlisted artifacts for the candidate pool. It is not an invitation to express enthusiasm. Any answer that is only about interest or excitement (not work done) is discarded — do not feed it into the CV.
4. **Adaptive follow-ups** (cap at 2): only when an answer was "Other" without detail, or a gap still has no signal. Each follow-up is another `AskUserQuestion` with 2 to 4 options.
5. If the user says "just run it", "skip the interview", or similar, skip to eval and use only what's in the CV.

### What to do with the answers

- Feed concrete experience answers into the artifact pool for the Summary (step 0a) and into the bullet rewriting step for Tailor CV.
- Discard any answer that is only motivation, enthusiasm, or interest — these belong in a cover letter, not the CV.
- Never fabricate. If an interview answer introduces a new claim not on the CV, ask whether to add it as a new bullet with specifics, or leave it off.
- Save a short `interview_notes.md` in the application folder capturing the Q&A. This is the paper trail for any new claims introduced into the CV.

## Command Routing

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Job Description text or URL | Full pipeline - auto-activates, no command needed |
| `start` | Manually invoke the full pipeline |
| `defend` | Skeptical-interviewer dry-run on a tailored CV: challenge claims, surface weak bullets the user cannot defend in 30 seconds |
| `respond` | Draft answers to application essay questions for an existing application |
| `recompile` | Recompile tailored CV HTML to PDF after a manual edit |
| `tracker` | Show application status across `preparing/` and `submitted/` |
| `update` | Apply available updates from GitHub (prompted automatically every 3 days) |

---

## Writing Rules (apply to ALL CV, cover letter, and application response text)

### Strict dash rule (non-negotiable)
Never use em-dashes (`—`) or en-dashes (`–`) anywhere in any output artifact. This includes date ranges, page ranges, appositives, and stylistic pauses.
- Date and page ranges: single hyphen (`2023 - 2026`, `1349-1360`). Never `--`, `–`, or `—`.
- Appositives and pauses: rewrite with a colon, a comma, a parenthetical, or split into two sentences.
- Before saving any output, grep for `—`, `–`, and `--` and remove every occurrence in prose (HTML comments `<!--` ... `-->` are fine).

### Never
- Invent experience, metrics, skills, tools, or outcomes the user does not have.
- Use filler: "passionate about", "results-oriented", "proven track record", "leveraged", "spearheaded", "facilitated", "seamless", "cutting-edge", "directly aligned with", "demonstrating commitment to", "directly transferable to", "synergies".
- Use label-style transitions in prose: never "A concrete example from my own work:", "The technical problem I care about:", "In summary:". Open paragraphs with the thing itself.
- Write bullets whose mechanics any engineer could dismiss as "anyone can do that with a cron job". If a bullet describes a schedule or a mechanical step, rewrite to lead with the hard or unique architectural choice.
- Use passive voice when active works.
- Start every bullet with the same verb.

### Always
- Lead every bullet and every paragraph with the hard or unique part: the architectural decision, the counterintuitive choice, the thing that made the problem non-obvious.
- Lead sentence of any paragraph or answer summarizes what follows, so a skim reader gets the point.
- Keep bullets to roughly two lines. Tight, human sentence structure, not compressed telegram.
- Use the JD's exact vocabulary to reformulate real experience, never to invent.
- Short sentences. Action verbs. Specifics over abstractions. Name tools, projects, and concrete outcomes.

### Filler scan (run before saving any output artifact)

Before saving any HTML, markdown, or text output, run this grep against the full content. Any match is a rewrite trigger — not a warning.

```bash
grep -inE "passionate|results.oriented|proven track record|leveraged|spearheaded|facilitated|seamless|cutting.edge|directly aligned|demonstrating commitment|directly transferable|synergies|excited to|motivated by|seeking to|looking to|eager to|strong background|deep expertise|combining .+ with" <output-file>
```

Every match must be removed or rewritten before saving. There are no exceptions. If a phrase is in a quote from the user that is being reproduced verbatim, wrap it in an HTML comment to flag it for review rather than silently keeping it.

### Keyword injection (legitimate reformulation only)
- JD says "RAG pipelines" and CV says "LLM workflows with retrieval" → rewrite as "RAG pipeline design and LLM orchestration workflows"
- JD says "RL environments" and CV says "optimization on complex landscapes" → rewrite as "RL-inspired optimization across simulation environments"
- JD says "enterprise benchmarks" and CV says "evaluation protocols" → rewrite as "enterprise-grade benchmarking protocols"

---

## Professional Summary Spec (applies to every tailored CV)

The Summary is the single most-failed section in AI-generated CVs. It tends to collapse into aspirational fluff, meta-framing, and sentences that would be true of 10,000 other applicants. This spec exists to prevent that.

### The job of the Summary

Three things, in this order:

1. **Positioning.** Tell a skim reader in one sentence what kind of engineer / scientist / operator the user is and why that matches the JD. This replaces the old-school "Objective" line.
2. **Proof.** One or two concrete artifacts, results, or technical depth markers the CV body will back up. Falsifiable by anyone who reads the rest of the page.
3. **Keyword surface.** Carry 3 to 5 of the JD's top keywords naturally, so ATS and human skimmers both register the match in the first 5 seconds.

It is NOT a cover letter, NOT a mission statement, NOT a "why I'm excited" paragraph, and NOT a restatement of the CV.

### Step 0: Mine before you write (mandatory pre-writing step)

Do NOT draft a single word of the Summary until you have completed this extraction. Skipping it is the root cause of generic output.

**0a. Check interview notes first.**
Before touching the CV, read `interview_notes.md` for this application. Interview answers are first-class artifacts — the user may have described depth, scope, or outcomes that the CV does not expose. Add any usable claims from the interview into the candidate pool below. If there are no notes yet, proceed with the CV only.

**0b. Extract the JD's single most load-bearing requirement.**
One phrase. The thing the role cannot exist without. This becomes the anchor of S1.

**0c. Build a candidate artifact pool from the CV and interview notes.**
Scan every bullet in the CV and every answer in `interview_notes.md`. For each item that contains a number, a named system, a named outcome, or a named external user, add it to the pool. Mark each as:
- (a) direct match to the load-bearing requirement
- (b) adjacent
- (c) unrelated

Rank by specificity first, then JD relevance:

| Rank | Artifact type |
|------|--------------|
| 1 | Specific number (%, $, count, latency, throughput) |
| 2 | Named external users (companies, labs, open-source dependents) |
| 3 | Named publication or venue (NeurIPS, ICML, CVPR, etc.) |
| 4 | Named open-source project with measurable adoption (stars, forks, downloads) |
| 5 | Named internal system with named downstream team or user count |
| 6 | Named method or technique tied to a concrete outcome |
| 7 | Named project with no quantification — use only if nothing above exists |

**0d. Select exactly one artifact for S1 and one for S2.**
- S1 artifact: the highest-ranked item from pool (a) or (b) that can be stated as a noun phrase. This must be the most JD-relevant item — not the first item in the CV.
- S2 artifact: the highest-ranked item in the entire pool, regardless of JD relevance. The most impressive falsifiable proof point on the page. Must differ from S1.

**0e. Scope signal for S1: prefer scope over years when scope is more impressive.**
The S1 template includes `<X years / scope>`. Use whichever is stronger:
- Years of experience: use only when the number itself signals seniority (7+) or when scope data is unavailable.
- Scope: use when it is more impressive than years — e.g., "serving 50M users", "across three production ML teams", "deployed to 30 enterprise clients". Scope beats years almost every time for mid-career candidates.
- When both are strong, prefer scope: `<Role> with <scope> building <artifact>` reads more concretely than `<Role> with N years building <artifact>`.

**0f. If the pool has fewer than two distinct artifacts at rank 1-5:**
The CV is thin for this JD. Do not invent. Surface this to the user before writing:
> "I don't see strong proof points for [load-bearing requirement]. The strongest thing I found is [best pool item]. Can you tell me about any work in that area I can add? Even an unfinished project, a course project, or adjacent work counts if it's real."

Only after steps 0a-0f are complete, proceed to draft.

### Structural formula

**Exactly 2 to 3 sentences. 45 to 70 words total.** Longer than that and it stops being a summary.

- **S1 (Positioning + scope/years + headline artifact):** `<Role archetype> with <scope or X years> building <S1 artifact from pool> in <domain(s)>.` Leads with the hard or unique part, never with "passionate", "motivated", "excited", or "seeking". The artifact must be the highest-ranked JD-relevant item from the pool — not the first item you find.
- **S2 (Proof):** State the S2 artifact concretely. Name the thing. Must include at least one of: a specific number, a named external user, a named venue, or a named open-source project with adoption signal. This sentence must be verifiable against the CV body or interview notes.
- **S3 (optional, only if it adds a new signal):** A second depth marker the JD cares about (e.g., shipped open source used by others, peer-reviewed publications, specific stack depth). Cut S3 entirely if it would repeat S1 or S2.

### Hard bans (do not write these)

| Disease | Failed phrasing pattern | Why banned |
|---------|------------------------|-----------|
| **Aspirational closer** | "I'm genuinely excited about using X to build Y..." | Unfalsifiable. Breaks third-person register. Classic AI tell. |
| **Mission-statement closer** | "Motivated by making frontier AI systems safe, interpretable, and verifiably bounded..." | Belongs in a cover letter, not a Summary. |
| **Cover-letter closer** | "Targeting generative AI for protein structure on NVIDIA's PyTorch and CUDA stack." | "Targeting" is a cover-letter verb. The Summary describes who the user is, not what they are applying for. |
| **Meta-framing** | "Researcher applying to the Anthropic Fellows Program..." / "...suited to a Forward Deployed Engineer role with direct client delivery." | The reader already knows which role this is. Restating it wastes the most valuable line on the page. |
| **Vague scope claim** | "Engineer working across AI, HPC, and data..." | "Working across" means nothing. Replace with the most JD-relevant concrete artifact. |
| **Years as the only signal** | "Engineer with 4 years of experience in machine learning." | Years alone prove nothing. Always pair with a concrete artifact or scope. |

**Also banned outright:**
- First-person pronouns ("I", "I'm", "my"). Summary is third-person implied-subject, same as the rest of the CV.
- Verbs: "excited", "passionate", "motivated by", "seeking", "targeting", "applying to", "suited to", "looking to", "eager to", "driven by".
- Phrases: "results-oriented", "proven track record", "strong background in", "deep expertise in" (without the specific evidence in the same sentence), "combining X with Y" when X and Y are both generic.
- Naming the target company or role inside the Summary. That is cover-letter work.

### The falsifiability test

Before saving, read each sentence and ask: **"Is there a concrete claim here that a skeptical reader could fact-check against the CV body or interview notes?"** If the answer is no for any sentence, rewrite or cut it.

Also ask: **"Would this sentence be true of 10,000 other applicants to this role?"** If yes, it is filler. Replace with something specific: a named project, a number, a specific stack, or a named outcome.

### Keyword injection inside the Summary

The Summary must surface 3 to 5 of the JD's top keywords, but only by reformulating real experience. Never invent. Use the exact JD vocabulary where the underlying experience genuinely matches. Spell out the first use of acronyms that the JD spells out (e.g., "Large Language Model (LLM)") so both ATS and human skimmers match.

### Worked examples (before → after)

These use a fictional candidate, "Mohamed Ali": BS CS, MS ML, five years as a data platform and ML engineer. Use them as shape, not content. Write your own proofs from your own CV.

**Before (failed)** — Data Platform Engineer JD:
> Engineer applying to a Data Platform role at BigCo, with strong background in pipelines and a proven track record in distributed systems, excited to leverage AI for internal tooling.

Problems: meta-framing ("applying to"), banned phrases ("strong background", "proven track record"), aspirational closer, zero falsifiable claims.

**After (correct)**:
> Data platform engineer with five years building streaming Kafka pipelines and a Python feature-store layer serving two ML teams. Shipped an internal evaluator for retrieval-augmented LLM assistants that cut review time by 40 percent, with the whole stack open-sourced under Apache 2.0.

- S1: positioning + years (5 is not exceptional, but scope "serving two ML teams" strengthens it) + JD-relevant artifact (Kafka pipelines, feature store).
- S2: named result (40 percent), named artifact (open-source evaluator), JD keyword surface (retrieval-augmented LLM).
- No "excited", no "applying to", no first-person.

**Before (failed)** — ML Research Engineer JD:
> Empirical researcher applying to BigLab's ML Research team with years of ML experience, passionate about foundation models, motivated to push frontier AI systems forward.

Problems: every sentence is mission statement or meta-framing. "Years of ML experience" is years-as-only-signal.

**After (correct)**:
> ML research engineer with six years across supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and open-source reproduction of published benchmarks. Author of three NeurIPS papers on small-model distillation and maintainer of an evaluation harness used by two external labs for foundation-model regression testing.

- S1: concrete methods (SFT, RLHF), open-source reproduction as a falsifiable claim. Six years paired with concrete methods, not left naked.
- S2: named venue (NeurIPS), named artifact (evaluation harness), named downstream users (two external labs). Rank-2 and rank-3 artifacts both present.

**Example 3 (thin CV, junior / career-change candidate)** — Backend Engineer JD, candidate has 1.5 years experience and no production metrics:

Pool after 0c: two items at rank 5 (named projects, no numbers), one item at rank 6 (named method). No rank 1-4 items. Step 0f triggers — ask the user before writing.

After user provides context ("the API I built is used by three other teams at my company, roughly 200 internal users"):

> Backend engineer with two years building REST APIs and async job queues in Python and FastAPI. Designed an internal notification service now used by three teams across 200 employees, replacing a manual Slack-based process.

- S1: scope injected from interview notes ("used by three teams"), not invented.
- S2: named artifact + named users (200 employees) + named outcome (replaced manual process). Thin CV, but two falsifiable claims.
- No numbers were fabricated. The scope came from the user.

### Draft → critique → rewrite protocol (mandatory)

After writing the first draft, do NOT save it. Run this critique pass before saving anything:

1. **Read each sentence as a skeptical recruiter.** For each sentence ask: "What specific thing is this person claiming, and where in the CV or interview notes can I verify it?" If the answer is "nowhere" or "it's vague", the sentence fails.
2. **Apply the 10,000-applicant test** to every phrase: "Would this phrase appear in 10,000 other summaries for this role?" If yes, replace it with something that names a specific project, number, stack, or outcome.
3. **Check S1**: Does it name a concrete artifact (tool, system, method, project) — not just a domain ("AI", "data", "software")? If S1 says "building AI systems", it fails. It must say something like "building a Kafka-backed feature store" or "training RLHF reward models".
4. **Check S2**: Does it contain at least one rank-1 through rank-4 artifact from the pool? If not, go back to the pool and pick a stronger artifact. A rank-7 artifact in S2 is a last resort only.
5. **Check scope vs. years**: Is `<X years>` in S1 the only scope signal? If yes and the candidate has under 7 years, replace or augment with a concrete scope phrase.
6. **Audit every phrase that contains no number and no named user.** For each such phrase ask: "Is this doing positioning, proof, or keyword work?" If the answer is none of those three, cut it. Implementation details — stack choices, tools used, infrastructure methods — are not proof unless the tool itself is the named artifact. They belong in bullets or Skills, not the Summary. A phrase like "running on SLURM multi-node clusters with MPI-parallelized algorithms" describes how something was built; it is not a proof of outcome and it passes the 10,000-applicant test for any HPC candidate. Cut it and use the freed words for a second rank-1 artifact instead.
7. **Rewrite anything that fails.** The first draft almost always has at least one sentence that fails step 2, 3, or 6. This is expected. Rewrite before proceeding.

### Advisor gate: Summary-specific checks

When the advisor reviews the tailored CV, it must explicitly check these three failure modes in the Summary — not just a general read:

1. **S1 artifact test**: Does S1 contain a concrete named artifact (not just a domain or function)? Flag if not.
2. **S2 specificity test**: Does S2 contain a number, named external user, named venue, or named open-source project? Flag if not.
3. **Banned phrase scan**: Grep S1+S2+S3 for every banned verb and phrase listed above. Flag any match.

If any flag is raised, the advisor must propose a rewrite — not just note the issue.

### Verification checklist (before advisor gate)

## Step: Tailor CV (internal pipeline step, runs after interview)

This is not a user-facing command. It runs as part of the full pipeline after the interview answers are collected.

1. Read the canonical CV at `{{paths.base_cv}}` and `interview_notes.md` (if it exists).
2. Rewrite the Professional Summary following the **Professional Summary Spec** (below). The Summary `<div>` must include `text-align:justify;` in its inline style. Verify after writing.
3. Reorder and rewrite Experience and Projects bullets following the **Bullet Rewriting Protocol** (below).
4. Reorder Technical Skills categories so the JD-relevant category leads. Only include terms honestly demonstrated in the projects or experience sections. Remove any term that appears nowhere in the CV body.
5. Run the filler scan (see Writing Rules) against the full draft. Fix every match before proceeding.
6. Create the application folder at `{{paths.applications_dir}}/preparing/<Company>_<Role>_<YYYY-MM-DD>/`. Write `README.md` with the application metadata block (see Tracker spec). New applications always start in `preparing/`.
7. Save HTML to `<app-dir>/cv_tailored.html`.

### Bullet Rewriting Protocol

This applies to every bullet in Experience and Projects. Do not rewrite bullets mechanically — rewrite each one through the decision lens below.

**Step B0 — Read the bullet and the interview notes together.**
Check whether the interview surfaces any additional specifics for this role or project that are not yet in the bullet. If yes, incorporate them (with user confirmation if they contradict the CV).

**Step B1 — Apply the decision test.**
For every bullet ask: "What decision did this person make that a different engineer might have made differently?" That decision is the lead of the rewritten bullet. If no decision is visible, ask: "What broke, and what did they change to fix it?" That failure-fix is the lead.

If neither a decision nor a failure-fix is visible in the bullet or interview notes, rewrite at the level of specificity available and add `<!-- needs specifics -->`. Never fabricate.

**Step B2 — Apply the 10,000-engineer test.**
Read the rewritten bullet and ask: "Could this bullet appear on any engineer's CV at any company for this type of role?" If yes, it is still generic. Replace the subject or verb with something that names the specific system, constraint, or tradeoff.

- Failing: "Designed a distributed caching system to improve API performance."
- Passing: "Replaced a Redis cluster with a single-node Dragonfly instance after load testing revealed the cluster's cross-shard latency was the bottleneck, cutting API p99 from 340ms to 55ms under 10k concurrent users."

**Step B3 — Reorder by JD relevance.**
Within each role, move the most JD-relevant bullet to the first position. Within the full CV, move the most JD-relevant role or project section to lead its section. Do not reorder across sections — Education, Experience, Projects order is fixed.

**Step B4 — Inject JD keywords.**
Use the JD vocabulary to reformulate existing bullets where truthful. Never inject a keyword into a bullet where the underlying experience doesn't match. Examples are in the Writing Rules section.

**Bullet format rules (non-negotiable):**
- Two lines max. If it runs to three lines, split or compress.
- Lead with an action verb. No two consecutive bullets in the same role may start with the same verb.
- No passive voice when active works.
- Include at least one specific: a number, a named tool, a named system, or a named outcome. A bullet with none of these is not done.

## Step: Parse JD (internal pipeline step, runs before interview)

This is not a user-facing command. It runs automatically at the start of every pipeline.

1. If the input is a URL, delegate fetch to a Haiku sub-agent (`Agent` tool, `model: "haiku"`). Ask for the full JD text and company name. If fetch fails, ask the user to paste the JD text directly.
2. Extract 15 to 20 hard requirements and keywords from the JD text.
3. Read the canonical CV at `{{paths.base_cv}}`. For each hard requirement, mark as **clear match**, **adjacent**, or **gap**. Then classify every gap by severity and handle it as follows:

   | Gap tier | Definition | Action |
   |----------|-----------|--------|
   | **Hard blocker** | A required credential, license, or qualification the candidate clearly cannot claim (e.g., "must have active security clearance", "CPA required", "PhD required" when candidate has a BS) | Stop. Ask the user via `AskUserQuestion`: "This JD requires [X] which isn't on your CV. Do you want to proceed anyway, or skip this application?" Options: proceed (I'll explain in cover letter), skip this one. Do not continue until answered. |
   | **Soft blocker** | Years of experience significantly under requirement, or a primary technical skill that is absent but learnable (e.g., JD requires 5 years, CV shows 2) | Note it in a single line, continue. Make it Q2 in the interview (the biggest gap question). Surface it in the defend report as a "prepare to address" item. |
   | **Non-blocking gap** | A nice-to-have the candidate lacks, or a secondary skill not central to the role | Note silently. Use it to shape one interview question if relevant. Do not surface it to the user unprompted. |

4. Detect archetype from the `archetypes:` block in config (or defaults). This shapes Summary framing and Skills reorder in the tailoring step.
5. Detect company location to set page format: Letter (US, Canada) or A4 (elsewhere).
6. Feed the keyword list, gap map, and archetype into the interview questions (Phase 0) and the tailoring step.

No score is shown. No full report is produced. This step exists purely to give the interview and tailoring steps the information they need.

## Command: pdf (Recompile tailored CV to PDF)

Use this command to recompile an existing `cv_tailored.html` after a manual edit. If no tailored CV exists yet, run the full pipeline instead.

### Pipeline

1. Read the existing `cv_tailored.html` in the application folder. If no application folder is specified, list folders under `{{paths.applications_dir}}/preparing/` and ask the user which one.
2. Detect page format from the existing `README.md` (Letter or A4).
3. **Advisor gate BEFORE PDF compile.** If `advisor()` is available, call it with no parameters. Ask it to flag: weak or generic bullets, filler language, label-style transitions, any em/en-dash, and audit the Professional Summary against the Professional Summary Spec. Apply fixes to `cv_tailored.html`.

   **If `advisor()` is unavailable** or `advisor.enabled: false` in config: print `"advisor() unavailable; running self-review instead"`, then self-audit against the Summary verification checklist and the writing ban list. PDF compile proceeds only after either pass completes.

4. Generate PDF:
   ```bash
   node scripts/generate_pdf.js <app-dir>/cv_tailored.html --format {{pdf.page_format}}
   ```
6. Verify no em-dashes or en-dashes in prose:
   ```bash
   grep -nP '[\x{2014}\x{2013}]' <app-dir>/cv_tailored.html
   ```
   If any match outside HTML comments, fix and recompile.
7. Report: PDF path, page count, and a one-line summary of advisor-driven changes applied.

### Styling (lock to the canonical CV, do not change)

- **Font:** Times New Roman throughout (body and headings). ATS-safe. Override via `pdf.font_family` only if you know your recipient's parser.
- **Colors:** Section titles in dark green `#006400` with a black rule underneath. Body text black. Links black.
- **Layout:** Single-column, Letter format (US roles) or A4 (elsewhere). `0.5in` top/bottom and `0.65in` side margins via CSS `@page`.
- **Type sizes:** Name 22pt uppercase bold, body 10.5pt, section titles 11pt uppercase bold, line-height 1.35 to 1.5.
- **Separators:** Use a vertical bar ` | ` or `&nbsp;|&nbsp;` in header and inline metadata. Never a dash.

### Section order (lock to the canonical CV)

1. Header (name, contact row)
2. Professional Summary
3. Education
4. Selected Open Source Projects (or equivalent)
5. Experience
6. Technical Skills
7. Publications (optional)
8. Honors and Awards (optional)
9. Service and Leadership (optional)

### ATS Rules

**Formatting (hard requirements):**
- Single-column layout. No tables, sidebars, multiple columns, or text boxes.
- No headers or footers. ATS cannot read them. Keep contact info in the body.
- No borders, shading, decorative lines, or special symbols. Bullet points are fine.
- Standard font only: Times New Roman.
- Font size 10.5pt minimum for body text.
- No condensed or expanded letter-spacing. Normal spacing only.
- No accented characters or special characters (use "resume" not "résumé").
- No credentials (PhD, MBA) next to the candidate's name.
- No punctuation in the name line: no `( ) , / -`.
- Proper capitalization and punctuation throughout.

**Dates:** Always include months (e.g., `Aug 2020 - Aug 2026`). Dates appear to the right of the organization line.

**Section headers:** ALL CAPS. Use standard names where possible: EDUCATION, EXPERIENCE, PROJECTS, PUBLICATIONS, SKILLS.

**Keywords:** Distribute across Summary (top 5 keywords), first bullet of each role, and Skills. Use exact JD vocabulary in context. Spell out acronyms on first use: "Large Language Model (LLM)". Include the exact job title somewhere in the resume.

**Content:** UTF-8 selectable text only. No images of text. No misspellings. Length is not penalized by ATS. Keep to 2 pages for human readability.

## Mode: respond (Application essay answers)

When a JD or application form asks a written question (e.g., "Why are you a strong fit?"), run this pipeline before drafting a word.

### Step R0: Mine before you write (mandatory)

1. **Identify the essay question's core ask.** Strip it down to one phrase: what is the reader actually trying to learn? "Why are you a strong fit?" = "What specific thing have you built that maps to our core problem?" "Tell us about a technical challenge" = "Show us how you reason under pressure."
2. **Find the single best anchor artifact.** Scan `cv_tailored.html` and `interview_notes.md`. Pick the one project, role, or result that most directly answers the core ask. This becomes the anchor for the entire response. If two artifacts are equally strong, pick the one with a number.
3. **Draft the thesis in one sentence before writing anything else.** The thesis is: "[Anchor artifact] is why I'm a strong fit for [core ask]." If you cannot write this sentence concretely, the anchor is wrong — pick again.

### Structure and word budget

**Target: 250 to 350 words** unless the form specifies otherwise. Allocate the budget as follows:

| Paragraph | Purpose | Word budget |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **P1 — Lead** | One sentence that is the thesis. Reader stops here and still gets the full answer. | 30 to 50 words |
| **P2 — Technical argument** | Open with the problem or domain itself, not a label. State the hard or non-obvious aspect of the problem. No "The technical challenge I care about is..." — open with the challenge. | 90 to 120 words |
| **P3 — Lived example** | Open with the work, not a label. No "A concrete example from my work:" — open with the thing itself. Name the system, the decision, the outcome. At least one number or named artifact. | 80 to 100 words |
| **P4 — Closer** (optional) | One sentence connecting back to the role. Cut if it reads as flattery or repeats P1. | 20 to 40 words |

### Rules

1. P2 opens with the domain problem, not with "I" or a label transition.
2. P3 opens with the artifact or the decision, not with "For example" or "In my work".
3. Apply all global writing rules: no em-dashes, no filler, no label transitions.
4. Run the filler scan (Writing Rules) against the draft before saving.
5. Run the advisor gate (or self-audit) before saving.
6. Save to `<app-dir>/application_response.md`.

## Mode: defend (Skeptical-interviewer dry-run)

The whole kairos discipline is "every claim on the page is falsifiable." `defend` mode tests that claim against the user, not against a model. It runs a 3 to 5 minute skeptical-interviewer rehearsal on the tailored CV before the user submits the application or walks into a real interview.

### When to run it

- Automatically as the last step of the full pipeline (after PDF compile), unless the user opts out with "skip defend".
- On demand via `defend` mode, against any tailored CV in `{{paths.applications_dir}}/preparing/` or `{{paths.applications_dir}}/submitted/`.

### How to run it

1. Read the tailored CV at `<app-dir>/cv_tailored.html`.
2. Pick **3 to 5 of the highest-stakes claims** in the CV. Selection rule: prefer claims that contain a specific number, a named system, or a strong outcome verb. Skip generic statements. The point is to stress-test the lines a real interviewer is most likely to circle.
3. For each picked claim, generate **one challenge question** in the voice of a skeptical interviewer. Use one of these shapes:
   - **The number**: "You wrote 'cut review time by 40 percent across forty daily queries.' What was the absolute baseline, and how was the 40 percent measured?"
   - **The architecture**: "You wrote 'designed a back-pressure protocol that degrades gracefully under partition skew.' Walk me through the failure mode it prevents and why your approach beats the obvious alternative."
   - **The ownership**: "You wrote 'led a migration from nightly batch ETL to event-driven Kafka streaming.' Who else was on that project, and what specifically was your decision vs. a team consensus?"
   - **The follow-up**: "If I asked you to draw the system on a whiteboard right now in two minutes, what would you draw first?"
4. Send the challenge questions as an `AskUserQuestion` batch (preferred) or, if the user would rather type, as a numbered prose list. Each question gets 2 to 4 picker options:
   - "I have a clean answer ready"
   - "I have an answer but it is rough"
   - "I would struggle to defend this in 30 seconds"
   - "This claim is overstated, fix the bullet"
5. **Adaptive follow-up** (cap at 2 rounds): for any answer that is "rough" or "struggle", ask one targeted follow-up to surface the real story or the real number. For "overstated", ask whether to soften, qualify, or remove the bullet.
6. **Save a defend report** to `<app-dir>/defend_report.md` with three sections:
   - **Strong**: claims the user can defend cleanly.
   - **Needs prep**: claims with rough answers, plus the user's notes for what to study.
   - **Bullet edits**: claims the user marked "overstated", plus the proposed rewrite.
7. **If any bullet was marked overstated**, offer to re-run the relevant section of the `pdf` mode pipeline (advisor gate included) to apply the rewrites and recompile the PDF. Never silently rewrite without confirmation.

### What `defend` is and is not

- It is a **rehearsal tool**, not a fact-checker. The user is the source of truth for whether they can defend a claim.
- It is **not** the eval mode's interview prep (Block F, STAR+R stories). Block F covers behavioural questions from the JD; `defend` covers technical questions from the user's own CV.
- It is **deliberately short**. 3 to 5 questions, two follow-ups max. The goal is to surface the one or two bullets the user cannot defend, not to simulate a full interview.

---

## Application folder README format

Every application folder created by the pipeline must contain a `README.md` with exactly this header block. The tracker depends on this schema — do not change the key names.

```markdown
# Application: <Company> — <Role>

- **Company**: <Company>
- **Role**: <Role>
- **Date created**: <YYYY-MM-DD>
- **Date submitted**: <YYYY-MM-DD or blank>
- **Status**: <Preparing | Submitted | Interviewing | Offer | Rejected | Withdrawn>
- **PDF**: <filename.pdf or blank>
- **Page format**: <Letter | A4>
- **Hard blockers noted**: <yes | no>
- **Defend report**: <defend_report.md or blank>
```

The pipeline writes this block when creating the folder (Tailor CV step 6). Update `Date submitted` and `Status` when the user confirms submission. The tracker reads only these keys — nothing else in the README is parsed.

## Mode: tracker (Application Status)

Read all subdirectories under `{{paths.applications_dir}}/preparing/` and `{{paths.applications_dir}}/submitted/`. For each, parse the README header block above. If a README is missing or malformed, show the folder name with status "README missing" rather than failing silently.

Display two tables, one per tier:

### Preparing
| Company | Role | Date Created | Status | PDF | Blockers |
|---------|------|-------------|--------|-----|---------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... | yes / no | yes / no |

### Submitted
| Company | Role | Date Submitted | Status | PDF | Defend |
|---------|------|---------------|--------|-----|--------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... | yes / no | yes / no |

After the tables, show a one-line count: `<N> preparing, <M> submitted, <K> with open defend items`.

---

## Full Pipeline (JD or URL pasted directly)

0. **Startup checks (BLOCKING)**: Run the full Startup sequence (Steps 0-3) above. Do NOT proceed to any pipeline step until `config.yaml` exists and is filled in, the canonical CV exists at `paths.base_cv`, and supporting files are copied. If any startup step requires user input (identity interview, CV builder), wait for it to complete before continuing.
1. **Parse JD** (see step above): fetch if URL, extract keywords and hard requirements, detect archetype and page format.
2. **Interview (Phase 0)**: run the adaptive interview. Skip only if the user explicitly says so.
3. **Tailor the CV**: section reordering, bullet rewriting, keyword injection, Professional Summary rewrite - all against real experience from the CV and interview answers.
4. **Advisor gate** before PDF compile, with fallback as described in the `pdf` pipeline.
5. **Compile PDF**, verify dashes, write `README.md` and `interview_notes.md` to the application folder.
6. **Respond**: if the JD or form includes a written question, draft `application_response.md` under the same writing rules and advisor gate.
7. **Defend**: skeptical-interviewer dry-run on the tailored CV. Save `defend_report.md`. Skip only if the user says "skip defend". If defend surfaces overstated bullets, offer to rewrite and recompile.
8. **Report**: application folder path, PDF path, response path (if any), defend report path, keyword coverage percent, one-line summary of what was tailored, count of bullets marked needs-prep or overstated.

The user pastes a JD and gets everything end-to-end. The only required interaction is answering the interview questions.
